 @header MOAssertions
 @discussion A replacement for the assertion macros in NSException.h.  This replacement has several improvements.  First, it takes advantage of the fact that vararg macros are now supported by both available preprocessors for gcc on OS X to remove the need for the MOAssert1, MOAssert2, etc...  style of multiple macros.  Second, it provides a funnel function that can be used to set a breakpoint that will catch any assertion prior to it being handed off to the current handler which can be very useful for debugging.  Third, the MOAssertionHandler class allows the current handler to be set (which NSAssertionHan dler has no public API for).  Finally convenience macros for testing certain properties such as isKindOf, conformance to protocol, etc are provided. 
 */

// The header is kind of convoluted, the main primitive macro intended for direct use is:
//     MOAssert(condition, NSString *description, ...) - general form, the primitive assertion macro
//
// In addition there are convenience macros for specific kinds of asserts
//     MOParameterAssert(condition) - uses a boiler-plate "bad argument" description
//     MOPreconditionAssert(condition) - uses a boiler-plate "broken precondition" description
//     MOPostconditionAssert(condition) - uses a boiler-plate "broken postcondition" description
//     MOInvariantAssert(condition) - uses a boiler-plate "broken invariant" description
//
//   (in all the above macros "condition" should be a boolean conditional suitable for use inside
//    the parens of an "if" statement)
//
// Other convenience macros perform common canned tests:
//     MOAssertClass(id object, Class class) - Asserts object is not nil and of type class
//     MOAssertClassOrNil(id object, Class class) - Asserts object is of type class (nil OK)
//     MOAssertString(id object) - Asserts object is not nil and of type NSString
//     MOAssertStringOrNil(id object) - Asserts object is of type NSString (nil OK)
//     MOAssertNonEmptyString(id object) - Asserts object is not nil and of type NSString and is not the empty string
//     MOAssertNonEmptyStringOrNil(id object) - Asserts object is of type NSString and is not the empty string (nil OK)
//     MOAssertRespondsToSelector(id object, SEL selector) - Asserts object is not nil and responds to selector
//     MOAssertRespondsToSelectorOrNil(id object, SEL selector) - Asserts object is responds to selector (nil OK)
//     MOAssertProtocol(id object, Protocol *protocol) - Asserts object is not nil and conforms to protocol
//     MOAssertProtocolOrNil(id object, Protocol *protocol) - Asserts object is conforms to protocol (nil OK)
//     MOAbstractClassError(Class class) - Asserts if self is an instance of class.  class should be the abstract superclass.
//
// Finally a few macros are provided whose conditions always fail and are used to indicate errors.
//     MOSubclassResponsibilityError(Class class) - Always asserts.  class should be the abstract superclass.
//     MOError(NSString *description, ...) - always asserts (no condition), you supply the error message
//     MOWarning(NSString *description, ...) - emits warning message, but does not assert/raise

 @function MOPWHandleAssertionFailure
 @abstract Funnel function for MOAssertion macros.  Good for breakpoints.
 @discussion This is the funnel point for assertion failures.  You never call it directly, but it can be useful for setting breakpoints.  The implementation uses +[MOPWAssertionHandler currentHandler] to get the current assertion handler and sends it either -handleFailureInMethod:object:file:lineNumber:description:arguments: if selector is non-NULL or -handleFailureInFunction:file:lineNumber:description:arguments: if selector is NULL.
 @param raise If this is YES then the call represents a real assertion.  Otherwise it represent a request for simply logging an error message.
 @param selector If the assertion came from a method, this is the selector of the method (_cmd).  If it came from a function this will be NULL.
 @param object If the assertion came from a method, this is the receiver of the method (self).  If it came from a function this will be nil.
 @param functionName This is the value of the compiler macro __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ in the scope the assertion came from.
 @param fileName This is the value of the compiler macro __FILE__ in the scope the assertion came from.
 @param line This is the value of the compiler macro __LINE__ in the scope the assertion came from.
 @param format An +[NSString stringWithFormat:]-style format string.  The remaining arguments are the replacement arguments for any % directives in the format string.
