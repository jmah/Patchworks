---------------------------------------------

This directory contains code for regular expressions taken from the MOKit
framework.  This code is licensed under the Ferris Public Source License Version
1.2 (see the 'LICENSE' file or <http://mokit.sourceforge.net/License.html> for a
copy). This code is part of the full MOKit, which can be found at its web site,
<http://mokit.sourceforge.net/>.

The prefix of public symbols has been changed from 'MO' to 'MOPW' in accordance
with Mike Ferris' recommendation posted to the MOKit SourceForge discussion
forums (included below). The #import directives have been changed to reference
sibling files instead of framework headers (i.e. #import <MOKit/MOKitDefines.h>
has been changed to #import "MOKitDefines.h"). The code is taken from MOKit
version 2.8 (the latest at time of writing).

Permission to include classes piecemeal was granted on the MOKit SourceForge
discussion forums. The discussion is included below:

Subject: 2 license related questions

1) In the About box of a software: do we put the whole MOKit license or just the
   last part? 
2) Is it possible to just use some classes in one project instead of the whole
   Framework?

Crediting MOKit in your About box is certainly appreciated, but not required. A
simple mention will be fine, maybe with the URL to the project web site. 
 
If you redistribute the actual MOKit distribution (either the binary or source
disk images) with your product (also appreciated, especially for devloper
oriented products), then, of course, the full license will be included in that
distribution. 
 
It is also fine if you want to take some of the classes from MOKit and embed
them in your application rather than using the entire framework. However, if you
do so, please rename all the globally visible symbols (class names, function
names, etc...) to have a prefix other than "MO". (Just rename abything that
already has an MO prefix to have a different one.) This is important because it
is possible that someone could write a plugin for your application (with or
without your knowledge) that uses the actual MOKit framework and if your
application contains some of the MOKit classes with the same names, this will be
a problem. 
 
Good luck, and I hope you find the framework useful, 
 
Mike
