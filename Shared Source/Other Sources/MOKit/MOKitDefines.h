// ABOUT MOKitDefines.h
//
// This little piece of cruft has to do with making sure that public symbols are
// exported from the framework and that private ones are not.  This applies to
// functions and global variables only.  Objective-C classes are all exported.
// Make sure that every non-static function or variable has a header
// declaration labelled either MOKIT_EXTERN or MOKIT_PRIVATE_EXTERN.
